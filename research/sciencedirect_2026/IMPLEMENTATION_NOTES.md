# Research Integration Notes (Feb 11, 2026)

## Source Files
- `Do-the-benefits-of-chess-instruction-transfer-to-academ_2016_Educational-Res.pdf`
- `Editorial-Board---Publication-Information_2016_Educational-Research-Review.pdf`

## Product Decisions Applied
- Kept chess-inspired reasoning activities, but avoided strong transfer claims.
- Framed chess effects as generally modest and implementation-dependent.
- Added explicit reflection/debrief prompts to increase transfer potential.
- Prioritized evidence evaluation, argument quality, and source checking across age bands.

## Seed Content Mapping
- `7_9_evidence_logic_1`: chess strategy puzzle
- `10_13_evidence_logic_1`: chess transfer check with evidence caution
- `14_18_evidence_logic_1`: strategic tradeoff board task

## UI Mapping
- Method badge (`content.method`)
- Research basis note (`content.evidence_note`)
- Debrief question (`content.debrief`)

## Elementary Science Pack Added
- Added 25 activities from an observation -> prediction -> test -> explain structure.
- File: `content/elementary_science_pack.json`
- Merged into `content/seed_activities.json`.
- Interaction style: multiple-choice only (MVP-compatible).
- Coverage includes: observation vs inference, fair tests, variables, data/graphs, CER mini, engineering iteration, adaptation/food-chain reasoning, and source checks.
